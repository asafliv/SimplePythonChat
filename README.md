# SimplePythonChat

A very simple Python based server & client.
I've created 2 files:
snakeChateServer.py - The server script
snakeChatClient.py - The client script

Usage instruction:
1. Start the server, in order to start it you will need to supply the right arguments 
(typing "--help" will show you the exact information you need)
2. Start up to 10! client instanses,  in order to start it you will need to supply the right arguments.
(typing "--help" will show you the exact information you need)
3. Snake chat is a broadcast chat, what the client types is sent to all clients that are connectd.
4. If you chose an already connected username you will be requested to connect again.
5. If a user types "--userList" he will recieve all the users that are connected.

Thanks for using SnakeChat :)
